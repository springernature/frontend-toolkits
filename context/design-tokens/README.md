# Design Tokens

## What Are Design Tokens

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

## The Design Tokens Workflow

Make sure you are in the `design-tokens` directory. You will then need to make sure you are using the correct version of node and that all dependencies are installed.

```bash
nvm use
```

```bash
npm install
```
### Design Tokens NPM Scripts

There are several NPM scripts available that can be run to generate the design tokens.

#### Deleting existing Design Tokens
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the front-end toolkits and the components, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-all
```
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the brand context folders, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-context
```
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the default brand context folder, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-default
```
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the Nature brand context folder, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-nature
```
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the Springer brand context folder, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-springer
```
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the Springer Nature brand context folder, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-springe-rnature
```
To delete all of the generated `scss` files from the all of the components, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:clean-components
```
#### Compiling Design Tokens for the front-end toolkits brand context

To generate the relevant `scss` files for the front-end toolkits from the literal Design Tokens, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:compile-literal
```
To generate the relevant `scss` files for the front-end toolkits from the alias Design Tokens, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:compile-alias
```
When these are run you may need to delete or rebuild the `index.scss` file that `@import`s all of the `scss` files in the folder. This is because the `index.scss` file is not automatically updated when the `scss` files are generated.

To delete any existing `index.scss` files, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:delete-index
```
To generate new `index.scss` files, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:build-index
```
#### Compiling Design Tokens for the front-end toolkits components

To generate the all `scss` files for the front-end toolkits brand components from the Design Tokens, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:brand-components
```
To generate the all `scss` files for the front-end toolkits components from the Design Tokens, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:components
```
note: this will override any and all existing `scss` files for the components.

To generate the `scss` file for a specific component for a specific theme the front-end tooolkits from the Design Tokens, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:component -- --component=component-name --theme=brand-context-theme
```
#### Generating Design Tokens documentation `json` files (experimental)

To generate the `json` files for the Design Tokens documentation for the Elements Design System, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:docs
```
#### Generating Design Tokens `json` for the figma tokens plugin (experimental)

To generate the `json` files for the figma-tokens plugin for Figma, run:
```bash
npm run tokens:figma
```
## Design Tokens Schema

The Design Tokens are defined in a `.json` file. The Design Tokens `json` is a set of nested json objects. The main `json` object (`aspect-ratio` in the above example) is the logical group of design properties. The first array of objects (`1x1` in the above example) is the name of the design property. Inside this object is the definition of the design property with all its necessary information, as described below:
### Design Tokens Object

- **name:** The name of the design token
- **value:** The value of the design token
- **description:** A description of the design token
- **type:** The type of the design token
- **category:** The category of the design token
- **themeable:** Whether the design token is themeable or not.
- **meta:**
  - **brand:** if the token is for a specific brand (springer, nature, springernature). If it’s a default theme, this can be omitted.
  - **public:** means that the design token will be generated by SD
  - **deprecated:** means if it’s deprecated there would be a message pointing to new value
  - **documented:** means that the design token will show up in the tokens documentation
  - **rxperimental:** if the token is part of a trial, user research, and subject to change.
  - **SassVariable:** A Sass variable is generated by SD and the value is shown in the documentation
  - **CSSCustomProperty:** A CSS Custom Property is generated by SD and the value is shown in the documentation.

#### Example

```json
{
    "aspect-ratio": {
        "1x1": {
            "name": "1x1",
            "value": "1",
            "description": "This is to make an item square",
            "type": "ratio",
            "category": "aspect-ratio",
            "themeable": false,
            "meta": {
                "public": true,
                "deprecated": false,
                "documented": true,
                "experimental": false,
                "SassVariable": true,
                "CSSCustomProperty": false
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## Design Token Tiering System

There are three tiers of Design Tokens:

- `literal`: The base set of tokens that are used to build the rest of the tokens.
- `alias`: The set of tokens that are used to build the rest of the tokens.
- `component`: The set of tokens that are used to build the rest of the tokens.

### Literal Design Tokens
These are the ‘locked’ tokens, that hold a value that should not change. These are primarily used to to create the Alias Design Tokens that can be used in developing components.

### Alias Tokens
