# Global layout with sidebar

The `global-layout-with-sidebar` component is a generic layout utility for creating two column layouts where

* One column is a sidebar with a chosen optimal width
* The other column takes up the rest of the available space
* The layout automatically wraps into one column based on a minimum percent-based width for the non-sidebar element

The purpose of the `global-layout-with-sidebar` is to enable responsive 1-2 column layouts without the necessity of media query breakpoints. It is based on [Every Layout’s Sidebar](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/sidebar/).

## Branding

The `global-layout-with-sidebar` component can be used in any brand context. You just need to import the component itself:

```scss
@import '@springernature/global-layout-with-sidebar/scss/10-settings/default';
@import '@springernature/global-layout-with-sidebar/scss/50-components/layout-with-sidebar';
```

## Usage

### Default settings

Using the default settings, the `c-with-sidebar` element will be `400px` in the 2-column configuration. Both columns grow to 100% width of their parent `c-with-sidebar` where they wrap into 1 column. By default, this happens when the non-sidebar (“Main content” below) becomes less than `50%` of the total width.

```html
<div class="c-with-sidebar">
    <div>
        Main content
    </div>
    <div class="c-with-sidebar__sidebar">
        Sidebar content
    </div>
</div>
```

### Sidebar on left

Somewhat unconventional, but the component can take it!

```html
<div class="c-with-sidebar">
    <div class="c-with-sidebar__sidebar">
        Sidebar content
    </div>
    <div>
        Main content
    </div>
</div>
```

### Custom settings

The `global-layout-with-sidebar` component’s settings are mapped to CSS custom properties, meaning you can alter them inline.

In the following example, the `gap` between the columns is `2em`, the 1-column layout is triggered when the main content goes under `66.666%`, and the sidebar is `300px` wide in the 2-column layout.

```html
<div class="c-with-sidebar" style="--with-sidebar--gap: 2em">
    <div style="--with-sidebar--min: 66.666%">
        Main content
    </div>
    <div class="c-with-sidebar__sidebar" style="--with-sidebar--basis: 300px">
        Sidebar content
    </div>
</div>
```
