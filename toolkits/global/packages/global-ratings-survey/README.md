## Usage
In order to use the component the instructions in all of the following sections must be carried out.
### Install
Install the Global Ratings Survey package:
```shell
npm install @springernature/global-ratings-survey
```
You will also need to ensure you have its dependencies installed. These are Brand Context and Global Forms:
```shell
npm install @springernature/brand-context
```
```shell
npm install @springernature/global-forms
```

### Sass
Include the necessary Sass files in your project in this order (if they are not already there!):
```sass
@import '@springernature/brand-context/[YOUR BRAND HERE]/scss/core.scss';
@import '@springernature/brand-context/[YOUR BRAND HERE]/scss/enhanced.scss';
@import '@springernature/global-forms/scss/00-tokens/default.tokens.scss';
@import '@springernature/global-ratings-survey/scss/00-tokens/default.tokens.scss';
@import '@springernature/global-ratings-survey/scss/30-mixins/ratings-survey-button';
@import '@springernature/global-forms/scss/50-components/forms';
@import '@springernature/global-ratings-survey/scss/50-components/ratings-survey';
@import '@springernature/brand-context/default/scss/60-utilities/hiding.scss';
@import '@springernature/brand-context/default/scss/60-utilities/spacing.scss';
```

### JavaScript
Include the component JavaScript in your application bundle:
```js
import {ratingSurveys} from '@springernature/global-ratings-survey';

ratingSurveys();
```

### HTML
Add the component HTML to your project by consuming and rendering the component's view template. It is assumed your project is able to consume the component's Handlebars view template found in the `/view/` directory.

If you are unable to consume view templates in your project you can still use this component. You can use the component demo to generate the HTML that you need. The following process is suggested to generate your HTML:

1. Edit the JSON data file found at `/demo/context.json` and define the data you need for your instance (see below Data section) 
2. Run `npm run demo -- -p global-ratings-survey`
3. Copy the `<aside>` and its contents from the generated demo file at `/demo/dist/index.html` and paste it into the relevant location in your project

### Data
The component's view template requires a data model to be passed to it. An example of the data model can be seen in the component's demo. This can be found in `/demo/context.json`.

> **Note**
> Some of the data for this component is considered static and should **not** be edited. This concerns all of the data that is passed to the Global Forms component. 

#### Editable data properties
