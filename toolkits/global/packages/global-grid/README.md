# Grids

This module makes available tools for building a classic grid system (note: nothing to do with the CSS Grid spec, for now).

You need to install `bourbon-neat` version `4.0.0` or higher at the same level as this component e.g.

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@springernature/global-grid": "^2.0.0",
  "bourbon-neat": "^4.0.0"
}
```
