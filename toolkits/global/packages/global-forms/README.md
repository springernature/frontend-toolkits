# Global Forms

**IMPORTANT:** _This is a **release candidate** representing an ambitious reworking of the global-forms component, including design tokens integration, at a component level, for the first time. It is expected to need some additional work before a full release can be made. Tokens are generated to the `scss/00-tokens` folder and cannot be edited directly. If you need to temporarily add or override variables, please do this in a `10-settings` folder, one level down. The Elements Design System team will assess these changes for making these variables tokens later._

This component includes a number of form fields and related templates. It is designed to make it as simple as possible to create an HTML form.

The component does not include any JavaScript. States (such as an invalid/error state) are defined at a data level. If you're using client-side processing, you might benefit from compiling the form’s handlebars template in the browser.

## Usage

First, include the necessary Sass files in your project.

```scss
// Include this with your settings
@import '@springernature/global-forms/scss/10-settings/default';

// Include this with your other components
@import '@springernature/global-forms/scss/50-components/forms';
```

Then you will need to register the handlebars partials in the `/view` folder. 

There are two options for rendering form fields: 

1. Compile fields independently, using their respective templates from the `view/fields` folder.
2. Organise multiple related fields into fieldsets using the data structure like that shown in `demo/context.json`. For example, a group of fields used to let someone enter their address. In this case, you’ll have to iterate over a `fieldsets` array something like this:

```html
<form action="some/url">
    {{#with myFormData}}
		{{#with errorSummary}}
			{{> errorSummary }}
		{{/with}}
		{{#each fieldsets}}
			{{> fieldset }}
		{{/each}}
    {{/with}}
</form>
```

### Fieldsets

Fieldsets are used to group fields itemised under their `fields` property. If you do not want to include a (visible; screen reader identifiable) fieldset element or legend, simply omit the `legend` property. The following example shows a simple form body with a single, unlabelled fieldset containing two text inputs:

```json
"fieldsets": {
    [
        {
            "fields": [
                {
                    "template": "text",
                    "label": "Your name",
                    "id": "your-name",
                    "name": "your-name"
                },
                {
                    "template": "text",
                    "label": "Your email",
                    "id": "your-email",
                    "name": "your-email"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

If you do wish to include a legend, you can use HTML to style it and add semantic meaning. In most cases, legends should be headings, with the heading level determined by the page structure.

```json
"fieldsets": {
    [
        {
            "legend": "<h2>My level 2 legend</h2>",
            "fields": [
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Fields

The `template` property sets the type of field - for example, `"template": "text"` renders a text input field. Aim to make the `template`, `label`, `id`, and `name` properties mandatory parts of your data schema.

This component supports a wide range of standard form field attributes. For example, to include a `readonly` attribute on your text input, you can include a property of the same name on the data:

```json
{
    "template": "text",
    "label": "Your email address",
    "id": "your-email",
    "name": "your-email",
    "readonly": true
}
```

The `hint` property adds hint text under the main label text but _inside_ the `<label>`. This means it is automatically available to screen reader software.

```json
"hint": "This will be the email address you used when registering"
```

The `optional` property adds _“(optional)”_ to the label text.

```json
"optional": true
```

In addition to these top-level properties, you can add any arbitrary attributes using the `attributes` field property. For example, you can add a `data-test` attribute for your text input’s unit testing:

```json
{
    "template": "text",
    "label": "Your email address",
    "id": "your-email",
    "name": "your-email",
    "attributes": {
        "data-test": "someValue"
    }
}
```

### Errors

Each field can have an `error` property. The inclusion of the property means the field is in an error state. The property value (a string) defines the error message the user sees.

```json
{
    "template": "text",
    "label": "Your name",
    "id": "your-name",
    "name": "your-name",
    "error": "Enter your name"
}
```

You can summarise errors using a top level `errorSummary` property adjacent to the `fieldsets` property. Each error in the errors array must point to the `id` of the input it relates to and repeat its `error` message:

```json
"errorSummary": {
    "id": "summary",
    "title": "There are problems",
    "errors": [
        {
            "id": "your-name-error",
            "error": "Enter your name"
        },
        {
            "id": "checkbox-terms-error",
            "error": "Agree to the terms to continue"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Making choices

`Select` fields (using the `<select>` element) define the user’s options with an `options` property, which must be an array. The `selected` property is a Boolean:

```json
"options": [
    {
        "label": "Horse",
        "value": "Horse"
    },
    {
        "label": "Platypus",
        "value": "Platypus",
        "selected": true
    }
]
```

Radios define choices with an `inputs` array:

```json
{
    "template": "radios",
    "label": "Animal",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "label": "Horse",
            "value": "Horse",
            "name": "animal"
        },
        {
            "label": "Monkey",
            "value": "Monkey",
            "name": "animal"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `name` property is placed at the top level and inherited by each input.

Radios are always grouped together in a `fieldset`, so the group label (“Animal”, here) renders as a `legend` not a `label`.

You might want to show users an additional field when they select a particular radio. For example, revealing a text input field for them to give more specific information about the option they’ve selected.

These fields can have any properties of a standard form field. Set these properties using the `fields` property (an array), like this:

```json
{
    "label": "Monkey",
    "value": "Monkey",
    "name": "animal",
    "fields": [
        {
            "template": "text",
            "label": "What type of monkey?",
            "id": "monkey-type",
            "name": "monkey-type",
            "hint": "Chimps are not monkeys"
        }
    ]
}
```

Unlike radios, which are always used in sets of two or more, you can have a single checkbox field. To give users a set of checkbox choices, organise the checkboxes into a `fieldset`:

```json
{
    "legend": "<h2>Which animals do you like?</h2>",
    "fields": [
        {
            "template": "checkbox",
            "label": "Monkeys",
            "id": "checkbox-monkeys",
            "name": "checkbox-monkeys"
        },
        {
            "template": "checkbox",
            "label": "Horses",
            "id": "checkbox-horses",
            "name": "checkbox-horses"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Buttons

A `template` of `buttons` defines a set of button controls, displayed inline (using Flexbox and `gap` for tidy wrapping). 
The `type` property for each individual button corresponds to the `type` HTML attribute. For example, here is how you would include a submit button:

```json
"fields": [
    ...
    {
        "template": "buttons",
        "buttons": [
            {
                "type": "submit",
                "label": "Submit",
                "modifiers": ["primary"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

The `modifiers` property is an array. Each value should match one of these modifiers form the brand context’s button utility styles:

* primary
* secondary
* tertiary
* contrast
* ghost
* xsmall
* small
* large
* full-width

### Datalist

Text input fields can have a `datalist` property, which lets you implement autocomplete. This takes two properties: `id` and `options` (an array):

```json
"datalist": {
    "id": "my-datalist",
    "options": [
        "monkey",
        "horse",
        "emu",
        "platypus",
        "cockroach",
        "whale"
    ]
}
```

This builds a standard `datalist` field, with `option`s, and associates it with the input. If a `datalist` already exists in the markup, provide just the `id` and forego the `option` property. If you want to use a custom-built autocomplete solution using JavaScript, omit the `datalist` property from the field altogether.
