# Global Forms

This component includes a number of form fields and related templates.

The component does not include any JavaScript. States (such as an invalid/error state) are defined at a data level. If you're using client-side processing, you might benefit from compiling the form’s handlebars template in the browser.

## Usage

First, include the necessary Sass files in your project.

```scss
// Include this with your other components
@import '@springernature/global-forms/scss/50-components/forms';

// Include these with your utilities (if not already there)
@import '@springernature/brand-context/default/scss/60-utilities/buttons.scss';
@import '@springernature/brand-context/default/scss/60-utilities/spacing.scss';
```

Then you will need to register the handlebars partials in the `/view` folder. There are two options for rendering form fields: 

1. Compile fields independently, using their respective templates from the `view/fields` folder.
2. Organize your data into arrays of fieldsets and fields and loop over these arrays, assigning the `globalFormFieldset` and `globalFormField` partials respectively.

Here is an example base template implementation:

```html
<form id="my-form" action="/something">
    {{#each myFields}}
        {{> globalFormField}}
    {{/each}}
</form>
```

For this example, you might have two simple inputs for a name and password:

```json
"myFields": {
    [
        {
            "template": "globalFormText",
            "label": "Your name",
            "id": "your-name",
            "name": "your-name",
        },
        {
            "template": "globalFormPassword",
            "name": "password",
            "label": "Your password",
            "id": "password"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Fields

The `template` property sets the type of field - for example, `"template": "globalFormText"` renders a text input field if that is what you have registered the **view/fields/globalFormText.hbs** template as. Aim to make the `template`, `id`, `label`, and `name` properties mandatory parts of your data schema.

This component supports a wide range of standard form field attributes. For example, to include a `readonly` attribute on your text input, you can include a property of the same name on the data:

```json
{
    "template": "globalFormText",
    "label": "Your email address",
    "id": "your-email",
    "name": "your-email",
    "readonly": true
}
```

#### Hints

The `hint` property adds hint text under the main label text but _inside_ the `<label>`. This means it is automatically available to screen reader software.

```json
"hint": "This will be the email address you used when registering"
```

#### Required

Fields are required by default. Avoid asking for information you don't really need. To explicitly mark fields as required, `requiredSuffix` will append text—such as an asterisk—to the label. This property permits HTML, meaning you can hide the asterisk character from screen readers.

```
"requiredSuffix": "<span aria-hidden=\"true\">*</span>"
```

The `required` and `aria-required="true"` attributes are applied automatically. Unless `novalidate: true` is applied on the field’s data, browser validation will warn the user when they have not filled out the field upon submission.

If you do need to ask for optional information, set `optional: true`. This will remove `required` and `aria-required="true"` as well as appending the text “(optional)” to the field label. 

#### Data properties

In addition to these top-level properties, you can add data properties as a `dataAttrs` array, which can be useful for unit testing.

```json
{
    "template": "globalFormText",
    "label": "Your email address",
    "id": "your-email",
    "name": "your-email",
    "dataAttrs": {
        "test": "someValue"
    }
}
```

This would create the following attribution: `data-test: someValue`.

#### Errors

Each field can have an `error` property. The inclusion of the property means the field is in an error state. The property value (a string) defines the error message the user sees.

```json
{
    "template": "globalFormText",
    "label": "Your name",
    "id": "your-name",
    "name": "your-name",
    "error": "Enter your name"
}
```

You can summarise errors using a top level `errorSummary` property. Each error in the errors array must point to the `id` of the input it relates to and repeat its `error` message:

```json
"errorSummary": {
    "id": "summary",
    "title": "There are problems",
    "errors": [
        {
            "id": "your-name-error",
            "error": "Enter your name"
        },
        {
            "id": "checkbox-terms-error",
            "error": "Agree to the terms to continue"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Select fields

`Select` fields (using the `<select>` element) define the user’s options with an `options` property, which must be an array. The `selected` property is a Boolean:

```json
"options": [
    {
        "label": "Horse",
        "value": "Horse"
    },
    {
        "label": "Platypus",
        "value": "Platypus",
        "selected": true
    }
]
```

#### Radio groups

Radios define choices with an `inputs` array:

```json
{
    "template": "globalFormRadios",
    "label": "Animal",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "label": "Horse",
            "value": "Horse",
            "name": "animal"
        },
        {
            "label": "Monkey",
            "value": "Monkey",
            "name": "animal"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `name` property is placed at the top level and inherited by each input.

Radios are always grouped together in a `fieldset`, so the group label (“Animal”, here) renders as a `legend` not a `label`.

Pictographic radios are also supported and can be enabled by including the property `pictographic: true`:

```json
{
    "legend": "Pictographic Radios",
    "fields": [
        {
            "template": "globalFormRadios",
            "label": "Rating",
            "description": "A scale of 5 feelings conveyed using images that range from terrible to great. The feelings represent how you feel about this page.",
            "id": "radios-rating",
            "name": "radios-rating",
            "pictographic": true,
            "boxed": true,
            "inputs": [...]
        }
    ]
}
```
There are two other properties in the above example that are used to configure pictographic radios: `groupDescription` and `boxed`.

It is strongly recommended that the `groupDescription` property is set when defining a group of pictographic radios to ensure users of assistive technologies are provided with sufficient information to understand the group of radio elements.

The `boxed` property allows for `border` and `padding` to be applied to the pictographic radio's SVG elements. When this setting is enabled the CSS classname `c-forms__label--boxed-icon` is applied to the component's HTML to facilitate this.

As with ordinary radio elements, data for each pictographic radio element is defined in the `inputs` array. In this example, the path data is removed for brevity.

```json
"inputs": [
    {
        "label": "Bad",
        "value": "Bad",
        "id": "radio-bad",
        "svg": "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"transparent\" stroke=\"currentColor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">...</svg>",
        "showLabel":  false,
        "imageDescription": "An image of a cartoon face with a frown."
    },
    {
        "label": "OK",
        "value": "OK",
        "id": "radio-ok",
        "svg": "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"transparent\" stroke=\"currentColor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">...</svg>",
        "showLabel":  false,
        "imageDescription": "An image of a cartoon face with a neutral expression."
    }
]
```

However, there are properties in the above example that are unique to pictographic radios: `svg`, `showLabel`, and `imageDescription`.

The images used for pictographic radios must be defined as inline SVG elements using the `svg` property. This property is mandatory and must contain a string defining the inline SVG code. Please note that special characters within the string such as double quotes must be escaped.

The `showLabel` property allows for the `<label>` text to be visually hidden. If you choose to enable this setting for a radio input label please ensure it does not negatively impact the user experience, particularly accessibility.

It is strongly recommended that the `imageDescription` property is set when defining a pictographic radio to ensure users of assistive technologies are provided with sufficient information to understand the meaning of the image that has been used.

The width and height of each SVG can be overridden using the CSS variable `--forms--pictographic-radio-icon-size`. This can be applied to the SVG html in the `style` attribute as follows:

```json
"svg": "<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"--forms--pictographic-radio-icon-size: 2rem\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">...</svg>"
```

#### Checkboxes

Unlike radios, which are always used in sets of two or more, you can have a single checkbox field. To give users a set of checkbox choices, organise the checkboxes into a `fieldset`:

```json
{
    "legend": "<h2>Which animals do you like?</h2>",
    "fields": [
        {
            "template": "globalFormCheckbox",
            "label": "Monkeys",
            "id": "checkbox-monkeys",
            "name": "checkbox-monkeys"
        },
        {
            "template": "globalFormCheckbox",
            "label": "Horses",
            "id": "checkbox-horses",
            "name": "checkbox-horses"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Hidden fields

You can hide any field from visibility (also from screen reader software and keyboard interaction) using `hidden: true`. If you want to use a field of `type="hidden"`, you need to use `template: globalFormHidden`. It is recommended you also apply `hidden: true` to such fields because it will remove the inter-field margin. In the following example, note the `label` is omitted since hidden fields are not user facing.

```json
 {
    "template": "globalFormHidden",
    "id": "hidden-field",
    "name": "hidden-field",
    "hidden": true,
}
```

#### Inline fields

It is possible to display fields in a horizontal line, using the following `template` value:

```json
"template": "globalFormInlineFields"
```

For example, here’s a possible field definition for a search bar, comprising an input and submit button:

```json
{
    "template": "globalFormInlineFields",
    "gap": "1em",
    "fields": [
        {
            "template": "globalFormText",
            "name": "search",
            "id": "search",
            "label": "Search",
            "hideLabel": true
        },
        {
            "template": "globalFormButton",
            "type": "submit",
            "label": "Search",
            "modifiers": ["primary"]
        }
    ]
}
```

* **`fields`**: Individual fields are defined in a `fields` array.
* **`gap`**: The gap between the fields; any valid `gap` value.
* **`hideLabel`**: You can visually hide labels with the `hideLabel` property _without_ removing them from screen reader output. Only do this if there is another visual form of label (the “Search” label of the submit button in this case). 
* **`nowrap`**: Not used in the previous example. Stop the individual fields from wrapping (beware of narrow viewports).

### Supplementary fields

You might want to show users an additional field when they select a particular radio or checkbox. For example, revealing a text input field for them to give more specific information about the option they’ve selected.

These fields can have any properties of a standard form field. Set these properties using the `fields` property (an array), like this:

```json
{
    "label": "Monkey",
    "value": "Monkey",
    "name": "animal",
    "fields": [
        {
            "template": "globalFormText",
            "label": "What type of monkey?",
            "id": "monkey-type",
            "name": "monkey-type",
            "hint": "Chimps are not monkeys"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Buttons

A `template` of `buttons` defines a set of button controls, displayed inline (using Flexbox and `gap` for tidy wrapping). 
The `type` property for each individual button corresponds to the `type` HTML attribute. For example, here is how you would include a submit button:

```json
"fields": [
    ...
    {
        "template": "globalFormButtons",
        "buttons": [
            {
                "type": "submit",
                "label": "Submit",
                "modifiers": ["primary"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

The `modifiers` property is an array. Each value should match one of these modifiers from the brand context’s button utility styles:

* primary
* secondary
* tertiary
* contrast
* ghost
* xsmall
* small
* large
* full-width

### Datalist

Text input fields can have a `datalist` property, which lets you implement autocomplete. This takes two properties: `id` and `options` (an array):

```json
"datalist": {
    "id": "my-datalist",
    "options": [
        "monkey",
        "horse",
        "emu",
        "platypus",
        "cockroach",
        "whale"
    ]
}
```

This builds a standard `datalist` field, with `option`s, and associates it with the input. If a `datalist` already exists in the markup, provide just the `id` and forego the `option` property. If you want to use a custom-built autocomplete solution using JavaScript, omit the `datalist` property from the field altogether.

### Fieldsets

Fieldsets are used to group fields itemised under their `fields` property, with a legend to label the fieldset itself. There are two ways to add fieldsets to your form:

1. Create a field with the `template` value of `globalFormFieldset` and an array of fields using the `fields` property.
2. Create an array of `fieldsets` and loop over them, assigning the `globalFormFieldset` partial.

#### (1) The fieldset field

```json
{
    "template": "globalFormFieldset",
    "legend": "<h1>Login</h1>",
    "fields": [
        ...
    ]
```

#### (2) A fieldset array

In this case, each fieldset is an object:

```json
"myFieldsets": [
    {
        "legend": "<h2>One fieldset</h2>",
        "fields": [
            ...
        ]
    },
    {
        "legend": "<h2>Another, different fieldset</h2>",
        "fields": [
            ...
        ]
    }    
]
```

And the accompanying template would include this:

```html
{{#each myFieldsets}}
    {{> globalFormFieldset}}
{{/each}}
```

A fieldset can include one or more nested fieldsets. If you are including headings in your fieldsets, be careful to use a heading level that reflects the nesting level. For example, if a fieldset’s legend uses `<h2>`, any child fieldset within it should use `<h3>` or no heading level at all.

#### Legends

You can use HTML to style the legend and add semantic meaning. In most cases, legends should be headings, with the heading level determined by the page structure.

```json
"fieldsets": {
    [
        {
            "legend": "<h2>My level 2 legend</h2>",
            "fields": [
                ...
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For accessibility, do not use a fieldset without an accompanying legend. If a legend is not appropriate, neither is a fieldset; just use fields without a fieldset parent.
