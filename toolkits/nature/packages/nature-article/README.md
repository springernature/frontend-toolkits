Set the context for Nature branded articles rendered via the shared article renderer.

- [Global Article](#global-article)

## Global Article

The Nature article package inherits from the [global-article package](https://github.com/springernature/frontend-toolkits/tree/master/toolkits/global/packages/global-article), anything that then needs to be either overridden from global or added specifically for nature can be added within this package. This README will detail anything that is added for this specific brand.
